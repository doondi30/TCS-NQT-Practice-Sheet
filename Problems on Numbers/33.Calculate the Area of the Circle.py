# Problem Statement: Given the radius of the circle, calculate the area of the circle.

# Examples:

# Example 1:
# Input: N = 5
# Output: 78.5
# Explanation: Using formula  πr2 for finding area of circle we get area as 78.5

# Example 2:
# Input: N = 4
# Output: 50.2
# Explanation: Using formula  πr2 for finding area of circle we get area as 50.2
